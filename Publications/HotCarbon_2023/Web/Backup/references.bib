	abstract = {Technology companies reduce their datacenters' carbon footprint by investing in renewable energy generation and receiving credits from power purchase agreements. Annually, datacenters offset their energy consumption with generation credits (Net Zero). But hourly, datacenters often consume carbon-intensive energy from the grid when carbon-free energy is scarce. Relying on intermittent renewable energy in every hour (24/7) requires a mix of renewable energy from complementary sources, energy storage, and workload scheduling. In this paper, we present the Carbon Explorer framework to analyze the solution space. We use Carbon Explorer to balance trade-offs between operational and embodied carbon, optimizing the mix of solutions for 24/7 carbon-free datacenter operation based on geographic location and workload. Carbon Explorer has been open-sourced at https://github.com/facebookresearch/CarbonExplorer.},

Over the past decade power usage effectiveness (PUE) was the major focus for improving energy efficiency of Data Centres in particular. While PUE did result in significant energy efficiency improvements, it is not sufficient by itself. Huge energy efficiency gains are expected from optimizing hardware utilization, cooling and software stacks.

@inproceedings{Maji2022,
	abstract = {The ever-increasing demand for energy is resulting in considerable carbon emissions from the electricity grid. In recent years, there has been growing attention on demand-side optimizations to reduce carbon emissions from electricity usage. A vital component of these optimizations is short-term forecasting of the carbon intensity of the grid-supplied electricity. Many recent forecasting techniques focus on day-ahead forecasts, but obtaining such forecasts for longer periods, such as multiple days, while useful, has not gotten much attention. In this paper, we present CarbonCast, a machine-learning-based hierarchical approach that provides multi-day forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity. CarbonCast uses neural networks to first generate production forecasts for all the electricity-generating sources. It then uses a hybrid CNN-LSTM approach to combine these first-tier forecasts with historical carbon intensity data and weather forecasts to generate a carbon intensity forecast for up to four days. Our results show that such a hierarchical design improves the robustness of the predictions against the uncertainty associated with a longer multi-day forecasting period. We also analyze which factors most influence the carbon intensity forecasts of any region with a specific mixture of electricity-generating sources. We show that CarbonCast's 4-day forecasts have a MAPE of 4.80-13.93% across six geographically distributed regions while outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, CarbonCast is the first open-sourced tool for multi-day carbon intensity forecasts where the code and data are freely available to the research community.},
